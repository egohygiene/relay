# ADR-003: Use a versioned projection

## Context
Consumers require structured output.
## Decision
Emit a versioned Repository Intelligence validation report.
## Alternatives considered and rejected
Prose parsing was rejected as unstable.
## Consequences and tradeoffs
The contract must be versioned and tested.
## Implementation and evidence links
Pull request 24 contains the implementation.
## Replacement or exit strategy
A future major contract can supersede this record.
## Follow-up work
Relay will consume the normalized artifact.
