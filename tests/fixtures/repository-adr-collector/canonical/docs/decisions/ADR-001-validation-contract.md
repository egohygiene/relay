# ADR-001: Validate Repository Intelligence source records

## Context

Source records need deterministic local validation.

## Decision

Use Egolint-owned semantic rules.

## Alternatives considered and rejected

Parsing prose in Relay was rejected because it would duplicate meaning.

## Consequences and tradeoffs

Repositories must declare their adoption state.

## Implementation and evidence links

Issue 24 tracks the implementation.

## Replacement or exit strategy

Publish a new versioned rule catalog if the contract changes.

## Follow-up work

Relay will orchestrate the released validator.
