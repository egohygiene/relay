# Relay Vision

## Vision statement

repositories express CI intent through small, pinned, composable automation contracts whose implementation evolves in one owned library.

## Desired future state

- The core capability is independently usable and documented.
- Interfaces are versioned, inspectable, and replaceable.
- Local, self-hosted, and managed contexts can compose the capability without hidden lock-in.
- People can understand consequential behavior before approving it.
- Organization integrations strengthen the standalone product rather than making it dependent on the suite.

## Intended transformation

The project moves its domain from fragmented, implicit, and manually coordinated behavior toward explicit contracts, reusable automation, and evidence-backed operation.

## Anti-vision

a universal workflow that requires every secret, owns product release policy, or hides consequential behavior behind mutable references.

## Directional signals

- A first-time user can explain the boundary after reading the architecture.
- A consumer can integrate through a stable public contract.
- A maintainer can reproduce and validate a release.
- A contributor can distinguish implemented, proposed, and unavailable capabilities.

## Evidence and uncertainty

- **Observed:** The repository README establishes the intended boundary as the reusable GitHub Actions, workflows, automation components, and CI orchestration library for the organization; significant implementation remains incomplete.
- **Decided for this draft:** The repository owns the bounded concern described here and participates through versioned contracts.
- **Proposed:** Target systems and later roadmap phases remain proposals until accepted and implemented.
- **Open question:** Which parts of this draft should become active in the first independently versioned release?
